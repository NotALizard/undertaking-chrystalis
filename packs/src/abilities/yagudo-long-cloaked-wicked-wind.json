            "value": "<p>When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with a swirl of your extended and sharpened neck feathers that lifts you 5ft in the air before immediately dropping back down. When you do this, each creature within a 5ft radius must make a Dexterity saving throw of DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d8 slashing damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. <br />This damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).<br />You can use Wicked Wind a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>",
