At 5th level, you can cast the @Compendium[undertaking.spells-level-3.7UWC00HNXCOL4GFI]{Fireball} spell once per long rest. <br />You can use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Presence as your spellcasting attribute when casting spells this way.<br />If you are a spellcaster, you can also add these spells to your spell list. They are always prepared and do not count against the spells you can prepare each day.</li><li><strong>Element Flail:</strong> Of all parts of a Zhier, the tail is the point most connected to its spirit element. You can swing your tail like a natural weapon flail. This weapon has both the Light and Finesse properties, and deals 1d4 fire damage as it sears the point of collision.</li></ul></p>",
