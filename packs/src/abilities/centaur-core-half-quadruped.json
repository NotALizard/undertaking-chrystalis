In pure centaurs, the lower half is a horse, but mixed bloodlines sometimes have more exotic forms. <br />Due to this unique setup, you are always considered to be on a mount and are not slowed by weighty armor. However, you cannot reasonably mount other creatures unless they are two sizes larger than you, and you have a climbing speed of 0 feet.</p>",
