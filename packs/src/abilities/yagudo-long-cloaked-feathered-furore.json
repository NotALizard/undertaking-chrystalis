That creature must make a Strength (Save) check of DC 10 + your Proficiency Bonus. On failure, the creature must choose which of the two things you listed to let go of, as the wind catches it and flings up to 30ft in a direction of your choosing.<br />You regain the usage of this ability at the end of a long rest.</p>",
