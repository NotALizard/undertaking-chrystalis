When cast this way, you automatically succeed the twister Strength (Save) check unless you choose to fail it.&nbsp;<br />You can use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Presence as your spellcasting attribute when casting spells this way.<br />If you are a spellcaster, you can also add these spells to your spell list. They are always prepared and do not count against the spells you can prepare each day.</p>",
