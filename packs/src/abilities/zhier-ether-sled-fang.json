            "value": "<p>As an action, you gather winds around you and shoot forward 30 feet in a straight line, phasing through any creatures that would otherwise block you, and creating a small wind tunnel 15 feet past where you stopped. All creatures you phased through must succeed on a Dexterity (Save) check or take 1d6 slashing damage as a sharp wind cuts into them. This damage increases by 1d6 per growth level.&nbsp;<br />When trying to move through a solid object, construct, or creature of a larger size or wearing weighty armor, you slam into it instead, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage from the collision and dealing the same to the collision point or target. <br />This trait can only be used once per rest.</p>",
