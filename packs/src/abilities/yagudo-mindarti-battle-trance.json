You distance yourself from reality in preparation for the violence of combat. As you open your eyes again, you act purely on instinct, becoming @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.Y822OUCDEPAG0HS8]{Frenzied}. At the end of your turn, you can attempt to make a DC 13 Wisdom (Save) check to end the frenzy.<br />Frenzied conditions started this way are not affected by the Calm Mind racial trait.</p>",
