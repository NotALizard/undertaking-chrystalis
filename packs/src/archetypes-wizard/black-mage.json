Spells are made bigger, more dramatic, and more dangerous, as is the nature of progress. Black Mages are those who take this idea to its natural extreme. Black Mages cast spells longer and more forcibly than traditional wizards, pushing the arcane to its limits for the sake of sheer destruction. Such brute force spellcasting may get results, but are thought to leave scars on reality itself. One day, such scars could hurt the stability of reality. Black Mages, however, tend not to believe such rumors, or simply view it as a necessary means to an end. After all, saving or ending the right lives today can be worth the consequences in the long run.</p>",
