            "value": "<p><em>&lsquo;How deceptive,'</em> it&rsquo;s been said, <em>&lsquo;that mecians appear like rats of our world but have minds from another.&rsquo;</em></p><p>Mecians are short and lithe creatures, with long faces, a long tail, and moveable ears. Their faces are tipped with whiskers under a pink or black nose, and a long-muzzled mouth with two buck teeth. Their eyes are either a solid opaque, or white with round, colored irises around white pupils. The opaque and iris colors pull from the same pool, primarily being black, off-white, shades of red or pink, or a dark ruby, being black with a red reflective sheen. Less common colors include off-white (which usually comes with a slightly darker rim around the iris), yellow, pearlescent, and a dark citrine or topaz. Regardless of color, mecians are often described as having blank or emotionless eyes. Mecians are covered head-to-toe in short, dense fur of varying shades of grays, tans, browns, and blacks. About half the time this comes in two-toned colorations, with the darker color typically covering either their head, their head and back, or their head, back, and arms. This second tone can be solid, come in spots, or have spots that group into larger, more solid groups. Mecian noses can also sometimes have darker colorations. Their hands, feet, tail, nose, and ears are typically a pink-tan color, and are more sensitive than the rest of their body. Their tails are long and tapered, as long as about half their standing height and are fully articulate, and can be used as a third limb for simple tasks. Mecian genealogy has a higher mutation rate, with albinism, gigantism, and heterochromia in particular being more common in mecians than most other races.</p><p>Mecians, when first met, tend to be underestimated. With a naturally lithe and diminutive appearance and blank stares, folks are likely to find mecians more awkward than harmful. However, what doesn&rsquo;t show on the surface is that mecians are impressively wired creatures. Their thoughts are quick and powerful, moving their body with a certain intensity and precision not unlike creatures half their size, and the minds of those twice that. At a young age, this can manifest as a twitchy or nervous nature, moving in precise bursts of energy followed by stillness. Though this behavior gets refined with age&mdash;it&rsquo;s said you can tell a mecian&rsquo;s age by handing one a goblet and watching the water&rsquo;s ripples.</p><p>Blessed with unusual minds, their uncanny thoughts are naturally telepathic, but in a limited scope. As if an active radio, they are able to &lsquo;hear&rsquo; the crackling static of the minds around them. They can even convey certain feelings through this mind field, if to a limited degree. Regardless, what they send and say is limited and garbled, but can act as a guide for others around them to understand them beyond what their faces convey. This ability is intensified when coming in contact with others. As if using their body as a conduit, they can create a sort of psionic closed circuit with another creature, making the sharing of thoughts and feelings more possible. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for mecians to privately converse by leaning on each other, linking tails or hands, or bumping into each other.</p><p>In a world of magic and multitudes, one might expect to see more mecians interspersed across the realms. Indeed, under normal circumstances they multiply like flies. However, mecians are a race deeply bonded with their own&mdash;their slightly psionic nature makes them fantastic at communication with each other, but their reliance on it makes communication with others more difficult. Mecians from purely mecian societies simply lack the experience needed to use more subtle facial and vocal expressions, coming off blunt and cold as a result. This isn&rsquo;t helped by mecian&rsquo;s natural emotional fortitude that can cause them to come off as unfeeling. Furthermore, mecian accents, mannerisms, and culture are all influenced by their telepathy. When able to convey feelings without words, words alone feel deficient to a mecian&mdash;it&rsquo;s not their fault that others can&rsquo;t &lsquo;hear&rsquo; them. But to others, the difference between a caring and heartfelt mecian and a twisted and malicious one can be difficult to tell at a glance, too difficult. Unsurprisingly then that mecians tend to live with their own, and tend to stick together when traveling. Indeed, travelers have yet to disprove the saying: &lsquo;where there&rsquo;s one mecian, there&rsquo;s two.&rsquo;</p><p>That said, those mecians who have been forced to live without their kind tend to find new ways to feel connected to their new homes and neighbors. These mecians also tend to be more expressive, communicating and integrating well with their neighbors after overcoming an adjustment period.</p><p>Wherever they settle, mecians have great potential as technical laborers, scientists, and more. An individual&rsquo;s potential, however, is rarely achieved. Any society where mecians live tends to overflow with them through sheer duplicative force. As a result, mecians are often forced choose between proving their worth over their brothers and sisters or standing with them. For the former, standing out can be difficult&mdash;any personal failures can seem mountainous to overcome, and overcoming them may draw more malice from those around you. However, achievers do tend to crawl to the top of the pile. For the latter, mecians tend to stick together, overcoming group failures and celebrating group victories. These mecian communes, referred to as &ldquo;pods,&rdquo; can be anything from transactional to gestalt in nature. In either choice, mecians find a way to thrive in all societies, and as a culture as a whole.</p>",
