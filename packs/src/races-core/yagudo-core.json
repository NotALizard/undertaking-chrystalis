            "value": "<p>Yagudo are lightweight, bipedal avians with crooked beaks, piercing eyes, and long, wing-like ears. A plume of large, soft, water-retardant feathers covers most of their upper body, draping partially over their shoulders and midsection like a natural poncho or cloak. Their torso is covered with much smaller feathers, with legs mostly bereft, causing some yagudo to wear armor and clothing beneath their plumes for safety and comfort. These plumed feathers serve more than just to shield them from the elements. Yagudo have surprising control over their feathers, able to angle or flare them at will by controlling the muscles around them. Depending on the yagudo, some feathers can be quite rigid and or sharp, and can be angled or flared out for use in controlling their momentum.</p><p>The Yagudo&rsquo;s most striking ability, however, is their unusual method of flight. The thickest and largest feathers around their neck are attached to a special muscle that yagudo can flex to make spin on its axis around its lower neck. Yagudo put their arms down at their side and angle their spinning neck feathers to create lift, allowing them to fly. Yagudo have great control over their feathers, even mid-flight. They have the ability to open, flatten, or curve their rotor feathers mid-flight. Furthermore, their heads are topped with a small pair of wings sprouting from their head like ears. These can be rapidly flapped to control which way they&rsquo;re facing mid-flight, and keep themselves from spiraling&mdash;a pair of natural second rotors. When combined with a lesser control over their arm and body feathers, yagudo are able to move through the air with incredible ease.</p><p>Yagudo fairly consistently have greyish skin with shades of blue or black, but their feathers have much more diversity. While typically falling into shades of dark blues, purples, and blacks, it&rsquo;s possible for yagudo to have deep greens, cyans, and oranges or browns. Regardless, their feathers have a slight iridescent sheen to it, and usually flows together naturally, rather than having sharp patterns. Yagudo beaks are crooked and intense, typically with calm grey, tan, or black colorations. However, some yagudo branches are born with much brighter colors. Even for those without brighter beaks, a painted beak isn&rsquo;t uncommon for yagudo as a show of style or for religious purposes.</p><p>In a similar way, a common aspect of yagudo culture are masks, either over the head, beak, or both. These have cultural and stylistic significance, but originally came from a desire to buffer the intense wind in their face that that their method of flight causes. Dying feathers, especially bleaching them, is a relatively common phenomenon as well for similar reasons. Beyond this, leg wraps and pants are common amongst yagudo to keep warm, with special light body armor used when combat is involved.</p><p>Yagudo can be found all over, but are particularly prevalent in high altitude high-perching environments. They tend to build homes in precarious locations, such as atop of trees or on cliffs, as they have little fear of falling in these situations and give them easy lift for takeoff. This preference has forced yagudo engineering to be particularly adept to support such precarious setups.</p><p>Yagudo are sometimes seen as wintry, with stoic faces and a strong exterior, that often belie their more passionate nature. The wind is a gift, one that yagudo never underestimate. Those who cannot fly may spend their time constructing wind-utilizing art or architecture. Some use their masterful feather control to make wind sculptures, temporary and complex shapes and air currents visible through fine colored dust. Yagudo wind dancers use this to an entirely unique effect, pouring colored dust under their feathers, which they hold in place until the moment they choose to release it, allowing certain movements to be accented with vibrant winds.</p><h3>Yagudo Branches</h3><p>Yagudo are mostly distinguished by the length of their feathers, the colors of their beaks, and their role within their community.</p>",
