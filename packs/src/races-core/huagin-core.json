            "value": "<p>Huagin are bipedal, aquatic, fish-like beings with scales ranging from skin-like smooth to fish-like sharp. They have long, thick tails attached to strong forms that have either two or four arms on them. Their heads are fish-like, often connected to thick, angled necks. These necks house their gills just under their dorsal fins, which are mostly concentrated on their head. These, with their webbed hands and feet, help them move through water at impressive speeds.</p><p>Huagin heads can vary in shape and type, sometimes with whiskers, sometimes with sharp teeth or large lips, sometimes with thick scales, sometimes with smooth. However, they all remain fairly uniform and recognizable. Their scales are monochromatic greens in the range of seafoam and teal, with fins ranging from greens to oranges and yellows. Their eyes have similar orange and yellow ranges with slightly vertical pupils. A common eye color for huagin are black eyes with black pupils, appearing as if dark orbs. These huagin are often jokingly called &ldquo;de huagin,&rdquo; a play on &ldquo;sea <em>de</em>vil,&rdquo; by other huagin, and is mainly said as a joke or compliment.</p><p>Huagin forms are humanoid, allowing them easy transition to and from land nations and cultures, but have a constant need for water to keep themselves from drying out. When remaining in water, their forms are capable, but are often slower than other fish in the sea. Their real strength, however, comes in their, well, strength. Facing a huagin in combat is asking for an onslaught of weapons and attacks big and small. Even those without extra arms are scarily capable at moving in for the kill or incapacitate.</p><p>Pair this natural capability in combat with the huagin culture&rsquo;s military organization and you may begin to understand why ancient civilizations dubbed them &ldquo;sea devils.&rdquo; This, however, also earned them a new title of &ldquo;sea angels&rdquo; from their supporters, who always felt they had someone watching over them while crossing the seas. Both of these perceptions come primarily because huagin are a wide-spanning culture that can be found in any part of the sea, with many allied huagin groups connected in a massive web of undersea territory. Allied flags were spread far and wide, and enemies never made it more than a few feet off the bow. Thus is the diplomatic power of a people that holds the majority of the world geometry.</p><p>Huagin have a long history of warlike tendencies, often viewing strength as the most important elements in life. It is for this reason that saba huagin often rise to the top of huagin society, with their extra size and arms often winning them one-on-one combat, at least in theory. In fact, many sa huagin, and even ba huagin have risen the ranks. There is no such thing as nepotism in huagin culture, as any who try it can only do so by backing their words up with actions. As a result, no matter who leads, the leader of a huagin society is something to be feared, both from their strong positioning and from the power they must personally wield to hold such a position.</p>",
