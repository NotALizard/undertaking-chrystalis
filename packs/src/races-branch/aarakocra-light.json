      "value": "<p>Light-winged aarakocra have smaller and lighter wings than average, about 3 feet wide when extended.  The shortened size and reduced weight of their wings keeps light-wings swift and nimble.  However, much to their frustration, this prevents extended flight.  In a people that holds flight in such high regard, their limitations in flight can be seen as an obstacle to overcome, despite their exceptionally fast and nimble flying skills.</p>",
