      "value": "<p>Novvagin are covered in dorsal fins and grow batches of hard scale-like carapaces built into primarily their legs and torso.  Their faces are fierce and piranha-like, instead showing an impressively large range of emotion in the eyes.  Their arms and legs are noticeably longer than their brethren, causing them to stand about an inch taller when relaxed.  <br>With numerous fins and carapaced armor, novvagin are often confused for their deep-dwelling brethren, the ondagin.  However, despite their external similarities, novvagin have a highly unique internal musculature.  While they appear thin, all their strength is actually in their core muscles, which can be flexed back like springs and locked into place, to be released at a moment's notice in explosive power or mobility.</p>",
