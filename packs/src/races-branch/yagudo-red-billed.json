They also have some of the loosest and fastest-growing feathers of any yagudo, molting more often as a result. Using this to their advantage, cornered red-bills pluck their own feathers for use as weaponized darts, or kick up storms of molted feathers to slice into attackers. Feather plucking is a fairly painful proposition, but worth it in a pinch.</p>",
