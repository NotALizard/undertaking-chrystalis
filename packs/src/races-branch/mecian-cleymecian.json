            "value": "<p>In mecian etymology, &ldquo;cley-&rdquo; equally means &ldquo;without attribute&rdquo; and &ldquo;moldable.&rdquo; An apt title for those set apart from their people and forced to learn other capabilities as a result.</p><p>Born without the genetic ability to make psychic connections like their peers, cleymecians are social outcasts from their own kind. Not through lack of trying from their peers, they simply are neither fully able to understand nor communicate with their kind, a people so used to accenting their communication with emotive psychic signals that could never truly be translated into words. Not just that, their minds aren&rsquo;t built for psychics from any source, finding even the simplest psionic communication uncomfortable at best, painful at worst. The cherry on top; there&rsquo;s a connection between cleymecian parents and cleymecian children which has made relationships them all but taboo.</p><p>As a result, cleymecians must work extra hard to connect with their peers who quite simply think differently than they do. Through this life-long struggle, cleymecians are expert physical and verbal communicators, using every part of them to make up for their &lsquo;disability.&rsquo; Cleymecians have even developed a unique form of movement, or &lsquo;dance&rsquo; as some call it, to help translate meaning to others through sight rather than mind. It&rsquo;s considered so effective by some, that they believe a cleymecian&rsquo;s hypnotic movements have a psychic component to it in itself, whether subconsciously or not.</p><p>All of this makes cleymecians the only ones of their kind that connect easily with outside cultures, commonly ending up as diplomats and ambassadors as a result of their greater experience in what other races call &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; communication.</p>",
