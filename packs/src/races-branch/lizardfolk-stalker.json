Lizardfolk stalkers are hunters, capable of hunting in even the thickest and deepest marshes, and with the hungriest maws for combat. To earn this role, stalkers hardened their scales daily through manual prodding and calousing over years, causing a natural defensive layer able to even block some blades.</p>",
