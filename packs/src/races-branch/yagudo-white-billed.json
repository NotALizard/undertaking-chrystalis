            "value": "<p>Unlike red-billed yagudo, white-bills are actually not named for a naturally white beak. Beaks in pales and whites are not entirely uncommon for yagudo. Instead, white-bills are a term for a group of yagudo trained in the sorceries and honorifics of death. The iconic white-billed yagudo wears a white mask and beak paint with bleached feathers and accents of black and leather, their entire body being meant to appear like a corpse. Though more modern iterations have loosened this design due to its fearsome appearance, it remains popular amongst white-bills. <br />White-billed yagudo are those who choose to more deeply study, understand, accept, and honor the dead as a next step to life. Realizing that only by mimicking and connecting to the powers of death do they better learn to respect the dead. <br />A common bedtime story for non-yagudo is that white-bills are terrifying bringers of death for those who do wrong. While seemingly exaggerated due to the respect they earn within yagudo communities, there is some truth to these stories. Due to the respect and power they have within their communities, when one does disrespect their dead, such as by grave robbing or resurrective necromancy, white-bills are sometimes called upon to put a stop to them. In either view point, a spurned white-bill is a terror to behold.</p>",
