These centaurs, called jennets amongst centaurs, have learned to walk more precisely, masking their clops. This prevents scaring off animals or other creatures with their roaring charges. This, along with their developed charm, makes them more popular amongst other bestial races and animals alike, especially as entertainers.</p>",
