            "value": "<p>While all yagudo have some form of natural talons, long-clawed yagudo have talons of a much more intimidating size and curvature. While an obvious use for these claws are hunting and combat, long-clawed yagudo tend to develop impressive finger control to match. Some use these skills to create, such as using their sharp talons and hardened hands for sculpting, whittling, and building. This increased hand dexterity has also spread to their arm feathers, allowing them some better control over them. Long-clawed yagudo are some of the only yagudo capable of wind dancing, which involves long-clawed holding colored dust under their feathers, releasing them during dances with swift movements to create vibrant wind-swept displays.</p>",
