It&rsquo;s a defensive mechanism from the public, but it&rsquo;s one they have gotten extremely good at. To a shadow goblin, passing someone in a dark alley should only be an experience felt by the shadow goblin, and not noticed by the other creature.</p><p>Shadow goblins tend to have black-tinted eyeballs, causing their eyes to stand out. Also, wider ears, much more ordered teeth, and a body structure closer to that of a short orc or humanoid aside from their longer face and ears.</p>",
