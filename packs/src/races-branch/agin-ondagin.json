            "value": "<p>Ondagin are covered in dorsal fins and grow batches of hard scale-like carapaces built into primarily their legs and torso. Their faces are fierce and piranha-like, instead showing an impressively large range of emotion in the eyes. <br /> With numerous fins and carapaced armor, ondagin are often confused for their spring-loaded brethren, the novvagin. However, despite their external similarities, ondagin are built primarily for aquatic life, their body pressurized for ocean floor, and water-starved on land. They&rsquo;re also born with an inactive second stomach, of sorts, that is used to store water or other liquids without absorbing it for usage later. When in a pinch, they can propel this water at targets like a cannon.<br /> Ondagin, perhaps due to their time in the dark quiet of the ocean, have also developed their minds in such a way that they grow into a natural capability in conjuration&mdash;the ability to make a mental image real.</p>",
