On the other hand, the idea that ghostwise halfling only keep their distance is just untrue. Many of them do travel away from their clans, always bringing a piece of the clan with them in the form of a memento. It is considered taboo to lose one&rsquo;s clan memento, and some harsher clans do not accept those who return without one. In either case, however, they manage to intermingle with other halfling or humanoid cultures with little issue. However, due to their unique halfling physiques, their bloodline is rarely kept from the learned.
