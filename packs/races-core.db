They have long tails, usually thin, and also have relatively long arms.  Their heads are fish-like, often connected to thick, curved necks that house their gills.  They have webbed hands and feet, and their bodies are often covered in dorsal fins to varying degrees, primarily on the head, neck, arms, legs, and back, giving them an exceptional ability to cut through water.  Depending on the branch, agin have different types of carapaces, some like turtle shells attached to their back, and others in various armor-like plates along the legs, torso, and sometimes arms.<br>Despite these consistencies, agin, as a race, have more variable genetic branches than most, ranging from more scaled and fish-like to more smooth and turtle-like.  Some consider quagin and novvagin so divergent as to be different races at this point, but as one of the most successful, long-lasting, and well-recorded aquatic cultures, agin have remained united in their identification.  <br>Agin have fish-like reflective scales, often of toned-down greys, blacks, blues, greens, teals, and whites.  Their brighter colored fins and carapaces of whites, yellows, reds, browns, cyans, and deep blues.  They tend to have slightly brighter undersides, sometimes with their fin colorations showing through.  Their eyes are often partially opaque looking, with bright white being most common, as well as other core colors.  Gills fall into the same color ranges as fins, but don't always match.  Occasionally, agin are born in more vivid colorations, such as striking whites, neons, or rainbow colorations.  <br>Agin tend to live short and somewhat traditional lives on paper, breeding quickly, moving to new locations with a clutch, and repeating.  In reality, this tends to lead to two defining elements of agin society.  Firstly, is that agin communities tend to live very tightly packed in water-filled communities, often located near the shore or in structures that stick out of the water, as newborn agin take a few weeks for their gills to fully grow in.  Secondly, and related to the first, is that agin in these communities often seek to stand out from their many tightly-packed peers.  This often leads to agin striking out and creating their own clutches and settlements, or otherwise taking on daring acts or styles to stand out against the crowd.  Agin with particularly stand-out colorations tend to be very divisive.  They're recognizable and often become social leaders, but also remind other agin just what they lack and can be hated for it.

While seemingly related to orcs with orcish features and being just as green of skin, goblins differ from orcs in their size, proportions, and facial structures. Goblins are always bald, often with greenish-pale skin varying on the levels of green and pale, and on rare occasions being more red instead. Their faces tend to be sharp, with longer chins and pointed ears, and their hands and feet are slightly bigger than the rest of the body might imply. Some goblins even grow natural keratin armor on their body in places. Their eyes are often fairly piercing, coming in oranges most often, but able to be any color based on genetics, and their teeth sometimes grow in a way that makes lips hard to cover them.</p><p>Goblins, ever-present in all corners of the world, ever a thorn in the side. Goblins came about ages ago, appearing all at once in a burst of rapid development that threatened society. They were unintelligent beasts, barely able to hold a shiv to stab you with, but what they lacked, they made up for in numbers. Then, just as the world was being overrun, they stopped. Their ability for rapid reproduction staggered and their population slowly began to dwindle. Raiding parties of goblins became more and more rare as knights and adventurers guarded the roads and settlements. Time passed, and goblins remained, but it seemed like that time of panic would be forgotten.</p><p>However, goblin numbers have begun to rise again in the past millennia, not because of some reversal of fates, but because of the rapidly rising intelligence of goblins. What once was simply a beast was now as capable of society as anyone. Many goblin camps still exist as dangerous and unintelligent beings, but those creatures, called urgalnotts by goblins, are not who they are anymore, nor who they want to be. Modern goblins are quick and resilient, able to take a hit and keep going or slide between those bigger than them like it&rsquo;s nothing. Their aptitude at adaption comes in handy as they become more urbanized and form their own societies where they can.</p><p>One skill that all goblins share is an aptitude for blending in, not being noticed, not being <em>targeted</em>. This has allowed them to survive for generations, and serves them well today. However, their ancestral past and present shadow-seeking has caused many goblins to still be seen as dangerous and shady today. The stereotype comes from truth, as lower urban sprawls became the new playground for some goblins to roam and thieve. However, many goblins are just as happy to make their own living, seeking out any challenge they can surmount. It&rsquo;s a common saying that goblins don&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re smaller than anyone, as their willingness to dive in and prove their mettle in tasks is a common trait of goblins&mdash;the result of generations of goblin cultures encouraging such an aspirational outlook.</p><p>For reasons like these, goblin mercenary bands are often effective and cost-efficient, especially as they work together against larger targets. Goblins have also been known to craft their own weaponry and armor. Often using a combination of recycled materials and solid craftsmanship, goblins are known as the inventors of the &ldquo;wabi-sabi&rdquo; style. Wabi-sabi may best be described as messy and chaotic when looking at it, but the quality and use of it really requires a deep understanding of craftsmanship. What may appear like charcoal welded to a stick may truly be as solid and powerful to wield, if not more so, than a typical warhammer.

{"name": "Core Ixudo", "type": "race", "img": "icons/creatures/birds/dove-pigeon-flying-white.webp", "system": {"description": {"value": "<p>To many avian races, there is a shared belief that all true avians are bound by the shared paradisiacal experience of flight. This is much to the chagrin and shame of the flightless ixudo, who appear almost more lizard-like in their featherless bodies than avian. Perhaps this explains the jealousy and disdain that many ixudo feel toward other intelligent avians. Or perhaps it explains the admiration and romanticism that some ixudo feel toward them instead. Ixudo mythology claims they came from the sky itself, falling like a comet, their wings burning up in the atmosphere. In this way, ixudo are no different than any other avian race in that they are irrevocably associated with the sky, and have a great desire to return to it.</p><p>Ixudo are long-necked, gangly, bipedal avians with crooked horns on their head, crooked, tooth-filled beaks on their face, and a pair of piercing eyes. They lack wings of any kind and are primarily featherless, except for a feathered tail, and a few standalone feather frills, usually along their arms, especially their elbows. Despite their scarcity, these feathers are often very solidly lodged and unlikely to molt. Ixudo tend to take great care of their few remaining feathers, as even the loss of what few they have is considered a tragedy. In turn, a large and undamaged frill is often considered something worth bragging about, and is shown off both to intimidate opposition and attract mates. Sometimes equipment is made out of feathers won from their enemies, as a similar showing of strength.</p><p>Despite these shows of strength, ixudo are somewhat flimsy, and cannot bear the cold. Ixudo settlements, therefore, tend to settle in warmer, but windy, environments, like jungles. Their exposed skin, having adapted to generations without feathers to defend it, have partially reverted to raptor-like scales, especially along the back of their arms, head, neck, and torso, where the sun beats down upon them. Their horns tend to grow long with some crooks in it, continually growing over their lifetime. An ixudo&rsquo;s age can be determined by counting the bumped rings on their horns. Ixudo beaks also have the unique distinction of housing pointed teeth. While not particularly sharp in all ixudo, this helps those with sharper sets to tear into meats and pray alike.</p><p>Ixudo scales are often in somewhat desaturated shades of green, grey, brown, or tan, generally with pale underbellies. Their feathers are generally bright and often primary colors, and their talons tend to be darker shades of purples and blues, much like their tongue. Their eyes are often cloudy grey orbs with slight color variations.</p><p>The strange mix of features, mythology, squawking speech patterns, and aggression towards &lsquo;ignorant&rsquo; outsiders, has caused ixudo to be seen as a more bestial race than most. In reality, ixudo are highly intelligent&mdash;often more so than the races that look down upon them. Even so, no matter how you slice it, ixudo aren&rsquo;t exactly what is commonly recognized as a typical avian race, with unusual combinations of features appended to a form only closest resembling an avian. It&rsquo;s long been rumored that their roots may be from an equally unnatural source, such as a cursed bloodline, or from biological experiments like those that made the HOUNDs. Ixudo are aware of these sayings more than they let others know, but ixudo tend to care little of these rumors&mdash;they are used to being defined by others behind their backs. Instead, ixudo culture encourages focusing on invention as an outlet, often in search for a path to the skies they once fell from, or else more personal dreams.</p><p>The ixudo&rsquo;s impressive drive and intelligence has brought numerous revolutionary inventions, such as the first mechanized engine&mdash;a tightly held trade secret that has earned the ixudo a level of respect and fear that little else has. This has led ixudo settlements to become filled with machines, warming up their village and adding to their comfort. These machines are often designed to be heavy and inscrutable to outsiders, so as to protect the designs from theft.</p><h3>Ixudo Branches</h3><p>Ixudo culture is often a class-based hierarchy, with galeborn bloodlines on top and windrisen on the bottom.

Their faces are tipped with whiskers under a pink or black nose, and a long-muzzled mouth with two buck teeth. Their eyes are either a solid opaque, or white with round, colored irises around white pupils. The opaque and iris colors pull from the same pool, primarily being black, off-white, shades of red or pink, or a dark ruby, being black with a red reflective sheen. Less common colors include off-white (which usually comes with a slightly darker rim around the iris), yellow, pearlescent, and a dark citrine or topaz. Regardless of color, mecians are often described as having blank or emotionless eyes. Mecians are covered head-to-toe in short, dense fur of varying shades of grays, tans, browns, and blacks. About half the time this comes in two-toned colorations, with the darker color typically covering either their head, their head and back, or their head, back, and arms. This second tone can be solid, come in spots, or have spots that group into larger, more solid groups. Mecian noses can also sometimes have darker colorations. Their hands, feet, tail, nose, and ears are typically a pink-tan color, and are more sensitive than the rest of their body. Their tails are long and tapered, as long as about half their standing height and are fully articulate, and can be used as a third limb for simple tasks. Mecian genealogy has a higher mutation rate, with albinism, gigantism, and heterochromia in particular being more common in mecians than most other races.</p><p>Mecians, when first met, tend to be underestimated. With a naturally lithe and diminutive appearance and blank stares, folks are likely to find mecians more awkward than harmful. However, what doesn&rsquo;t show on the surface is that mecians are impressively wired creatures. Their thoughts are quick and powerful, moving their body with a certain intensity and precision not unlike creatures half their size, and the minds of those twice that. At a young age, this can manifest as a twitchy or nervous nature, moving in precise bursts of energy followed by stillness. Though this behavior gets refined with age&mdash;it&rsquo;s said you can tell a mecian&rsquo;s age by handing one a goblet and watching the water&rsquo;s ripples.</p><p>Blessed with unusual minds, their uncanny thoughts are naturally telepathic, but in a limited scope. As if an active radio, they are able to &lsquo;hear&rsquo; the crackling static of the minds around them. They can even convey certain feelings through this mind field, if to a limited degree. Regardless, what they send and say is limited and garbled, but can act as a guide for others around them to understand them beyond what their faces convey. This ability is intensified when coming in contact with others. As if using their body as a conduit, they can create a sort of psionic closed circuit with another creature, making the sharing of thoughts and feelings more possible. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for mecians to privately converse by leaning on each other, linking tails or hands, or bumping into each other.</p><p>In a world of magic and multitudes, one might expect to see more mecians interspersed across the realms. Indeed, under normal circumstances they multiply like flies. However, mecians are a race deeply bonded with their own&mdash;their slightly psionic nature makes them fantastic at communication with each other, but their reliance on it makes communication with others more difficult. Mecians from purely mecian societies simply lack the experience needed to use more subtle facial and vocal expressions, coming off blunt and cold as a result. This isn&rsquo;t helped by mecian&rsquo;s natural emotional fortitude that can cause them to come off as unfeeling. Furthermore, mecian accents, mannerisms, and culture are all influenced by their telepathy. When able to convey feelings without words, words alone feel deficient to a mecian&mdash;it&rsquo;s not their fault that others can&rsquo;t &lsquo;hear&rsquo; them. But to others, the difference between a caring and heartfelt mecian and a twisted and malicious one can be difficult to tell at a glance, too difficult. Unsurprisingly then that mecians tend to live with their own, and tend to stick together when traveling. Indeed, travelers have yet to disprove the saying: &lsquo;where there&rsquo;s one mecian, there&rsquo;s two.&rsquo;</p><p>That said, those mecians who have been forced to live without their kind tend to find new ways to feel connected to their new homes and neighbors. These mecians also tend to be more expressive, communicating and integrating well with their neighbors after overcoming an adjustment period.</p><p>Wherever they settle, mecians have great potential as technical laborers, scientists, and more. An individual&rsquo;s potential, however, is rarely achieved. Any society where mecians live tends to overflow with them through sheer duplicative force. As a result, mecians are often forced choose between proving their worth over their brothers and sisters or standing with them. For the former, standing out can be difficult&mdash;any personal failures can seem mountainous to overcome, and overcoming them may draw more malice from those around you. However, achievers do tend to crawl to the top of the pile. For the latter, mecians tend to stick together, overcoming group failures and celebrating group victories. These mecian communes, referred to as &ldquo;pods,&rdquo; can be anything from transactional to gestalt in nature.

Orcs are often known for having a green skin, despite not unilaterally being the case. Orc hair is almost always naturally black or dark brown, or occasionally white, silver, or even a goblin-red. While they can grow hair of all types, orcs have a tendency toward complete or male-pattern baldness. As a result, clean-shaven heads, sometimes with a ponytail, is common a look amongst orcs. Orcs also tend to have two tusk-like lower canines that grow out of their mouth over time, often giving them an underbite. The size and angle of orc tusks can vary from dangerous to aesthetic, but often requires some level of filing to keep them from puncturing their own lips or face.

While not defining of orcs as a whole, orc culture is iconic for its focus on martial prowess, where the strongest rise to the top.

To some, this was considered simply befitting of their biology, one which makes musculature easy to build and keep, and adrenaline easy and rewarding to produce. However, what&rsquo;s often overlooked is that most orcs found little joy in the <em>senselessness</em> of the violence. Clans that encouraged it ended up losing many, not the least of which to exile, causing more amicable rival clans to appear and grow.

A plume of large, soft, water-retardant feathers covers most of their upper body, draping partially over their shoulders and midsection like a natural poncho or cloak. Their torso is covered with much smaller feathers, with legs mostly bereft, causing some yagudo to wear armor and clothing beneath their plumes for safety and comfort. These plumed feathers serve more than just to shield them from the elements. Yagudo have surprising control over their feathers, able to angle or flare them at will by controlling the muscles around them. Depending on the yagudo, some feathers can be quite rigid and or sharp, and can be angled or flared out for use in controlling their momentum.</p><p>The Yagudo&rsquo;s most striking ability, however, is their unusual method of flight. The thickest and largest feathers around their neck are attached to a special muscle that yagudo can flex to make spin on its axis around its lower neck. Yagudo put their arms down at their side and angle their spinning neck feathers to create lift, allowing them to fly. Yagudo have great control over their feathers, even mid-flight. They have the ability to open, flatten, or curve their rotor feathers mid-flight. Furthermore, their heads are topped with a small pair of wings sprouting from their head like ears. These can be rapidly flapped to control which way they&rsquo;re facing mid-flight, and keep themselves from spiraling&mdash;a pair of natural second rotors. When combined with a lesser control over their arm and body feathers, yagudo are able to move through the air with incredible ease.</p><p>Yagudo fairly consistently have greyish skin with shades of blue or black, but their feathers have much more diversity. While typically falling into shades of dark blues, purples, and blacks, it&rsquo;s possible for yagudo to have deep greens, cyans, and oranges or browns. Regardless, their feathers have a slight iridescent sheen to it, and usually flows together naturally, rather than having sharp patterns. Yagudo beaks are crooked and intense, typically with calm grey, tan, or black colorations. However, some yagudo branches are born with much brighter colors. Even for those without brighter beaks, a painted beak isn&rsquo;t uncommon for yagudo as a show of style or for religious purposes.</p><p>In a similar way, a common aspect of yagudo culture are masks, either over the head, beak, or both. These have cultural and stylistic significance, but originally came from a desire to buffer the intense wind in their face that that their method of flight causes. Dying feathers, especially bleaching them, is a relatively common phenomenon as well for similar reasons. Beyond this, leg wraps and pants are common amongst yagudo to keep warm, with special light body armor used when combat is involved.</p><p>Yagudo can be found all over, but are particularly prevalent in high altitude high-perching environments. They tend to build homes in precarious locations, such as atop of trees or on cliffs, as they have little fear of falling in these situations and give them easy lift for takeoff. This preference has forced yagudo engineering to be particularly adept to support such precarious setups.</p><p>Yagudo are sometimes seen as wintry, with stoic faces and a strong exterior, that often belie their more passionate nature. The wind is a gift, one that yagudo never underestimate. Those who cannot fly may spend their time constructing wind-utilizing art or architecture. Some use their masterful feather control to make wind sculptures, temporary and complex shapes and air currents visible through fine colored dust. Yagudo wind dancers use this to an entirely unique effect, pouring colored dust under their feathers, which they hold in place until the moment they choose to release it, allowing certain movements to be accented with vibrant winds.</p><h3>Yagudo Branches</h3><p>Yagudo are mostly distinguished by the length of their feathers, the colors of their beaks, and their role within their community.</p>", "chat": "", "unidentified": ""}, "source": "Core Rules", "portion": "core", "classDetails": "<p>Core Yagudo Traits</p><ul><li><strong>Attribute Increase: </strong>Your Dexterity and Intelligence each increase by 1.</li><li><strong>Lifespan:</strong> Yagudo reach maturity around 8 and tend to live up to age 50.</li><li><strong>Size: </strong>Medium; Yagudo are tall avians with long legs and many feathers on their upper half.

They typically have short fur, long, tuft-tipped tails, agile bodies, and partial, naturally spiky manes around the neck or spine. Their fur color varies wildly, ranging from blues, to oranges, to greens, to whites, and is often accented by certain amounts of dyed fur. Their eyes on the other hand, are fully genetic, with yellow or gold, orange, hazel, light brown, light green, amber, and blue being most common.</p><p>Despite their lack of hands, zhier are incredibly capable of holding, manipulating, and wielding objects with their mouths. In fact, zhier often prefer using weapons, held between their teeth, over biting as a form of hunting or warfare due to the sharpness and versatility weapons bring to the table and the tight grip on them their mouths can have. Zhier have incredibly strong neck muscles that allow them to quickly pick up and wield weapons that most would struggle to use with one hand.</p><p>All Zhier are born with a physical and spiritual connection to an element said to permeate them to their very core. This can most easily be seen in a zhier&rsquo;s fur color, which always falls into a set of colors based on their element. More directly though, this can be seen in their tail tuft, which is more elementally attuned than any other part of a zhier. In a pinch, zhier can swing their tail at creatures as a natural flail, the point of impact triggering a small burst of elemental energy to injure their target. <br />A zhier&rsquo;s control over their spirit element grows with them over time, and the nurturing of this gift can be considered a spiritual experience in its own right; an act of self-improvement. Surprisingly, these elements are not genetic&mdash;Zhier of one element can give birth to a zhier of any other. Some say that the element is based on a zhier&rsquo;s personality, or that the personality is based on the element. Others claim the weather in the last few weeks before a birth can determine its element. No matter the case, the elemental attunement has a great effect on a zhier&rsquo;s life, determining what capabilities and roles it can undertake.

This official granting of a sign is a cultural touchstone for many zhier societies, meant to help them define their path in life. When combined with their element, the results act as a guiding star for them in the darkest of times. A solar lightning zhier might consider it their duty to be a bolt of lightning out of the blue to those who need help, or believe they need to shoot for the stars in all things. While the results are intentionally interpretive, especially through communion with their elders or the sign itself, zhier often consider their result deeply personal. Despite this, these mantras tend to be quite mutable over their extremely long lives as they reach new milestones and personal developments, acting as a companion rather than a limiter.</p><p>As one of the few fully intelligent quadrupeds, Zhier often have a difficult time fitting into bipedal societies, but their resilience and mental flexibility makes adaptation easier than one might think.</p><h3>Zhier Branches</h3><p>Beyond their elemental birthrights, as zhier bodies reach physical maturity, they begin to show hints of their birth sign; airy fur, tougher skin down the spine, etc. Zhier are considered to be beginning their journey to adulthood&mdash;a process equivalent to adolescence&mdash;when their birth sign is clearly evident, tying them irrevocably to that of the sun, the moon, the earth, or the sky.</p><p>This official granting of a sign is a cultural touchstone for many zhier societies, meant to help them define their path in life.
